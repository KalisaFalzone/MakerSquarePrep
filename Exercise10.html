<!-- Exercise 10

Use the console as a simple caluculator. Use all of the following operators in various combinations: +, -, *, /, %.
Understand PEDMAS, use parentheses to change the answers to some of your previous equations.
From the console, calculate how many seconds old you are and alert that number.
Create a simple web page. Inside of a script tag, alert visitors that your site is extremely awesome and should thus be enjoyed with caution.
When a visitor visits your page, ask what their name is using prompt. Alert a greeting using their name.
After greeting them, ask them what their favorite sports team is. Secretly log a message trash-talking that team in the console.
